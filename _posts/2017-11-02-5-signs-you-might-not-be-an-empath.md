## 1.  You are oblivious to other people’s feelings.

Has a close friend ever experienced an emotion in your presence without your notice? There's a good chance that if you consistently overlook the people around you when they're in despair, you might not be an empath. 

## 2.  You notice others’ feelings, but aren’t affected by them.

You might notice somebody else's emotions, but if you don't experience them yourself, you're probably not an empath. 

## 3.  People refer to you as “unsympathetic,” or call you a sociopath.

Let's be real. If people regularly observe that you have no compassion or empathy, you're a sociopath, not an empath. 

## 4.  You sleep easy at night, even knowing a friend is in pain.

If your sleep is not disturbed by the suffering around you, you might not be an empath. 

## 5.  Robots and electronics feel at ease around you.

Empaths are known to cause disturbances in electric fields due to their powerful psychic waves. Non-empaths can expect the opposite--don't be surprised if your Roomba wants to cuddle, or your alarm clock coos like a dove.
