title: Buying this Leather Jacket Made Me a Cool Guy

When my Converse vegan leather jacket melted in a goopy plastic during the Firefly festival, I was heartbroken and vulnerable.  That jacket had been the signature piece of my identity for years.  I had bought it on clearance at Target, and ever since people would always ask me, is that real leather?  And I would say no, it’s vegan, and they would assure me it was still cool.  It was patterned after a motorcycle jacket, so when people asked me if I rode a motorcycle, I would tell them no, but I do bike to work, and again they were impressed.  I felt pretty cool.  But all nice Clearance jackets evented die, and this one was no exception.  With no leather jacket, I found people were less interested in me.  I tried to salvage the situation by keeping my Facebook profile picture one with the jacket, but over time I noticed my friend requests were reducing in number.  

The situation became dire.  Isolation began to set in—but not the kind of fashionable isolation that one might evince by wearing a leather jacket.  I resolved to correct this discrepancy between myself as I imagined—a leather jacket-wearing, freethinking rebel who had not given up his teenage rage against the machine.  I wanted people to look at me and think, he probably smokes cigarettes, listens to classic rock in cool bars and drinks whiskey, although I do none of those. 

I hit eBay and Amazon.com to make sure I had a new jacket for the autumn.  I couldn’t bear to face the season with only a hoodie.  The common wisdom was that you couldn’t find a good jacket for under $500, but that didn’t take into account the cost-savings of sweat shop labor.  So I purchased this Pakistani-made Leather King Police Motorcycle Jacket, and I could not be happier with the results.
