Thanksgiving is best-known as a time for spirited political discussion with your rarely-seen family members, so this season we've put together a listicle of all the best anti-Trump gear you could possibly bring to dinner and really stick it to your racist, religious, and Republican family members.

## 1. It's Mueller Time t-shirt

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Mueller-Anti-Trump-2017/dp/B0746LNZ3C/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1510004723&sr=8-5&keywords=anti-trump&dpID=41Y2LkoGvJL&preST=_SX342_QL70_&dpSrc=srch&linkCode=li3&tag=lovetruthlife-20&linkId=b63f491f77a98fd593af5c8e855bc114" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0746LNZ3C&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=lovetruthlife-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=lovetruthlife-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B0746LNZ3C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Let your family know that, unlike FOX News-watching, complicit Uncle Danny, you fully support Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, and that when the time comes for Mueller to "Lock Him Up," you're going to crack open a cold one.

## 2. Donald Trump Toilet Paper

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Novelty-Stocking-Democrats-Republicans-Hilarious/dp/B01H742KRW/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1510004723&sr=8-3&keywords=anti-trump&dpID=41iiqLbw7mL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch&linkCode=li2&tag=lovetruthlife-20&linkId=6f6219b552af9202fab18d4b8f4d56b1" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01H742KRW&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=lovetruthlife-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=lovetruthlife-20&l=li2&o=1&a=B01H742KRW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Switch out the paper when no one is looking, and throw out your family's Charmin.  If anyone's wiping their ass this Thanksgiving, it's going to be with Donald Trump's face.

## 3. "I Hate When I Wake Up In The Morning and Donald Trump Is President" Coffee Mug

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Morning-Donald-President-Election-Results/dp/B01MTKWO2G/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1510004723&sr=8-4&keywords=anti-trump&dpID=41UNkQXN5ML&preST=_SX300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch&linkCode=li3&tag=lovetruthlife-20&linkId=d5d04d61e71524925794a13374f46495" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01MTKWO2G&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=lovetruthlife-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=lovetruthlife-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B01MTKWO2G" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Put it right out there:  The first thing you do every morning is curse Drumpf.  Fill the mug up with wine, too, so your family knows you're **drinking** about it.

## 4. We Shall Overcomb: How to Survive the Presidency of the Angry Cheeto: The Resistance: The Anti Trump Adult Coloring Book

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/We-Shall-Overcomb-Presidency-Resistance/dp/1945056177/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1510005985&sr=8-8&keywords=anti-trump&linkCode=li2&tag=lovetruthlife-20&linkId=d3346604156d0fac478a537fe0b1e9f9" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1945056177&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=lovetruthlife-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=lovetruthlife-20&l=li2&o=1&a=1945056177" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

In fact, don't even talk to your family.  Just break out this adult coloring book and scribble angrily.

## 5. The Trump Lies Checklist T-Shirt

[You know that Trump has told at least 1318 lies as of October 2017.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/10/10/president-trump-has-made-1318-false-or-misleading-claims-over-263-days/?utm_term=.24af2233afc5)  You don't have time to list EVERY SINGLE ONE to your family, so when they demand to know why you're calling 45 a "miserable failure" and a "fucking liar," just point to your t-shirt.

## 6. The Resign Motherfucker cap

Wrap this [Drumpf.wtf's](https://www.drumpf.wtf/) 3x5 foot IMPEACH TRUMP flag around your neck like a cape.  You're a #Resistance superhero, and your family should be unsettled by how passionate you are. 

Profits from the sales of these flags goes to the Drumpf Fund, a hand-picked group of charitable causes that fight for civil rights and equal opportunity for all Americans in the face of this administration's dangerous policies.
