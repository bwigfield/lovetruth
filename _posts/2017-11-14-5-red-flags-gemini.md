5 Red Flags when Dating a Gemini
---

Astrology is important in any match up, but what are the pitfalls of dating a Gemini? Watch out for these red flags, and you won't have to worry about a thing!

## 1. They are paying for the crimes of a man named Hyde
You met them at this cute little venue, it was a 90s dance night and their smile caught you off guard.
The beat was jammin', you danced closer. Soon you were talking like old friends. But, by the third date you noticed something odd.
During your typical post-coital taco bell, you saw a check stub on the floor, it was addressed to Mr. Hyde.

## 2. You find out they made Mr. Hyde their only beneficiary
Things have been getting serious. You've gotten closer, met each other's families. It's a dream come true!
You don't know what you were doing before you met your lover. It's clearly destiny.
Or is it? You found that they wrote in Mr. Hyde as their only beneficiary in their will and not you. Typical!

## 3. They keep secluding themselves in their lab
Lovers are supposed to make time for each other aren't they? Ugh! Modern relationships are the worst.
You just want to spend a little quality time with your beloved darling, but they keep shutting you out and isolating in their stupid lab!
What could they be doing in their? Typical Geminis. Time to break out the ice cream and Netflix.

## 4. You catch them drinking a strange serum
What's this? You came home after a long night of work, hoping to catch some sympathy and maybe a cuddle. 
However, you walked in on them drinking a strange serum! When you asked what it was, they got aggressive. Wow.
Now that's what I call toxic.

##5. You find their confession
Welp, another one bites the dust. You ignored ALL the red flags of dating this Gemini, and look where that got us?
You found their confession, that they were taking a serum to entertain their vices as the personality of Hyde. Wow. 
Guess it's back to the drawing board of love!
