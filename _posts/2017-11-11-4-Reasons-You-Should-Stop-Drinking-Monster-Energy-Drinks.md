Many Americans purchase Monster brand energy drinks because they're short-sighted fools.  No matter how many times you tell them that they're bad for them, they persist.  They must be stopped.  Here's why you should NEVER drink a Monste energy drink.

## 1. It tastes awful. 

No Fear and Amp deliver the same great caffeine fix without the taste of Monster. 

## 2. High sugar content makes you a target for ants. 

Believe me, you don't want to wake up with ants in your blood. 

## 3. Last time you unleashed the Monster, terrible things happened. 

You can't do that again. The cycle must end.

## 4. You must be better than this. 

This cannot continue. 

## 5. Sales from Monster fund genetic research

It's true.  The producers of Monster Energy drink are mass-producing children fueled by caffeine and sugar for questionable ends.  I've seen enough science fiction movies to know that this can't end well.
