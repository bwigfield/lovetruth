If you were a ’90s kid, you might remember the [Satanic Panic](http://https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-brief-history-of-satanic-panic-in-the-1980s-1679476373).  Parents across the country had been losing their minds since the ’80s over so-called Satanic ritual abuse, wherein it was believed that black-clad witches skulked America’s suburbs to torment children.  Games like Dungeons and Dragons and Magic: The Gathering were considered stepping stones to a life of evil magick.  Unfortunately, this literal witch-hunt made life difficult for the country’s actual black-clad Satanists, who in no way menaced children, and led them to move their ritual circles and altars underground.  ’90s kids will never forget these childhood hangout spots that played host to warlocks after the witching hour.

# **1. Chuck-E-Cheese’s**

’90s kids will remember birthday parties at Chuck-E-Cheese’s as the last time they experienced real joy. Dave and Busters has made a good but failing attempt at recapturing the pure adrenaline of screeching children eating pizza, drinking soda, playing arcade games, trying to kill each other in a ball pit, and jamming along with soulless animatronic mice.  Parents, however, were often nervous about the parties of hollow men in longcoats that would loiter at the back tables painting their fingernails.  Your party was considered a disgrace if you didn’t stay in the restaurant until the clock crept towards 11 and the staff began robing the animatronic statues.  Then you had to leave or, as the waiter once warned, you might never leave. 

# **2. The Comic Book Store**

Trips to the comic store with Mom were always a blast, until she freaked out when you started to touch the Dungeons and Dragon Second Edition books or finger the crescent-bladed knives that hung over the altar.  Will Smith was right—[parents just don’t understand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW3PFC86UNI).  Even after the comic bubble burst and stores across the country began to shutter their doors, ’90s kids will remember seeing the men in leather masks watching them from the windows until the last Spawn and Batman posters were pulled down.  In spite of the recent popularity of superhero movies, today’s comic shops are still struggling because of sluggish sales, high cover prices, reader fatigue, and competition from digital markets.  In another ten years, these childhood hangout spots might completely vanish from America’s strip malls!  

# **3. The Arcade**

Today’s kids won’t remember the arcade, where ‘90s kids spent summer afternoons with unemployed relatives playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Mortal Combat and Samurai Showdown.  Things got weird when they installed the Time Crisis machine, however, and the women wearing vampire fangs started working in the front.  Parents feared that the snarling from the room beyond the counter was not, as you insisted, a Primal Rage machine that the nasty witches were refusing to let you play.  After a high profile child murder at an arcade in Kansas, however, most ‘90s kids knew better than to try to sneak behind the counter.

# **4. Church Summer Camp**

‘90s parents often tried to enroll their children in summer programs at Church to try to keep them on the straight and narrow, but they didn’t know that often, youth counselors were the exact sort of evil they were afraid of.  We showed our parents our drawings recreating our favorite scenes from Exodus, but we were instructed to never tell them about the weirder things the ministers instructed us to create, like the paper mache sculpture of the Whore of Babylon carrying a great chalice.  Church services with Mom and Dad were often a bore, but at youth camp, the hymns were backwards classic rock songs.

# **5. The Library**

'90s kids remember that the [Library Cop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9tP9fI2zbE) of Seinfeld fame was a caricature of the ever-present detective at the local library, but what Larry David got wrong was that the detective wasn't trying to track down lost books, he was trying to solve a murder.  These days, people don't go to libraries anymore.  Instead, they buy their books from Amazon.com, where they will never run afoul of the coven that meets in the basement!
