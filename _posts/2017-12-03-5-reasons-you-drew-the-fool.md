## 1. You are about to embark on a journey.

The Tarot can be interpreted as the story of the Fool going on a journey and becoming a magician.  If so, drawing the Fool might indicate that there's a trip in your future.

## 2. You're about to step off a cliff into the material world.

You're leaving the world of your airy thoughts and ideals and into the real--and you don't know what's waiting for you.  Are you ready?

## 3. You're a real wildcard.

Like the Joker, you're a damn wildcard.  Nobody can predict your spastic course through the universe.  Friend or foe--you can be anything!  And this is why your friends hate you, you loon.

## 4. You're being foolish.

You take your coat off and stand in the rain.  You're consistently late to pay your car insurance, because you're lazy.  You voted for Donald Trump.  For some reason, you're being foolish, and you need to stop--because you're tearing us apart.  You're tearing us apart.

## 5. You haven't shuffled your deck.

As the Fool is the first card in the Rider-Waite deck, it's possible that if it's the first card you've drawn from the top, it's because you have not shuffled the deck.  Get good or get out.
