## 1. Paprika from Paprika
In the movie Paprika, the title name character is the dream traveling alter ego of her serious real-life counterpart. 
You could say she's practically dreaming awake!

## 2. Karolina Dean from Runaways
Karolina is not only an alien, but her true form is made up of FUCKING RAINBOWS. She goes by Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds (LSD)
and even has a gender-shifting wife. The perfect costume for any Pisces.

## 3. Madoka from Puella Magi Madoka Magicka
Madoka is a magical girl, she has pink hair, and she is literally God. Enough said.

## 4. Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter

## 5. Sakura from Cardcaptor Sakura
Using the power of the Clow cards to summon ethereal beings, Sakura is the perfect quirky genki girl to show off your
offbeat vibes.
