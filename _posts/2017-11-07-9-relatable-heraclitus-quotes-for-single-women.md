## 1.  “No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.”

How true!  When a man ghosts you, the next time you see him, it’s like he’s a totally different person.

## 2. “The soul is dyed the color of its thoughts. Think only on those things that are in line with your principles and can bear the light of day. The content of your character is your choice. Day by day, what you do is who you become. Your integrity is your destiny - it is the light that guides your way.”

Translation:  DON’T BE SURPRISED WHEN A DOG IS A DOG.

## 4.  “Abundance of knowledge does not teach men to be wise.”

Just remember this when he’s “mansplaining” to you--just because he’s a wise-ass, doesn’t mean he’s wise!

![](/images/sleep2.jpeg)

There’s nothing worse than talking to a sleeping man.  They’re always spouting nonsense.

## 6.  “Even what those with the greatest reputation for knowing it all claim to understand and defend are but opinions.”

## 7.  “Man is most nearly himself when he achieves the seriousness of a child at play.”

Did they have Tinder in ancient Greece or what?

## 9.  (And the Sibyl, with raving lips uttering things mirthless, unbedizened, and unperfumed, reaches over a thousand years with her voice, thanks to the god in her.)”

It doesn't matter if people think you're mean, crazy and gross--never forget that there's a goddess in you.
