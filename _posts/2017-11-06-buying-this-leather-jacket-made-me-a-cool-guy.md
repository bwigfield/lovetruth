When my Converse vegan leather jacket melted into a goopy plastic mess during the Firefly festival, I was heartbroken and vulnerable.  That jacket had been the signature piece of my identity for years.  I had bought it on clearance at Target, and ever since. people would always ask me, "Is that real leather?"  And I would say no, it’s vegan, and they would assure me it was still cool.  It was patterned after a motorcycle jacket, so when people asked me if I rode a motorcycle, I would tell them no, but I do bike to work, and again they were impressed.  I felt pretty cool.  But all nice Clearance jackets eventually die, and this one was no exception.  With no leather jacket, I found people were less interested in me.  I tried to salvage the situation by keeping my Facebook profile picture set to one with the jacket, but over time I noticed my friend requests were reducing in number.  

The situation became dire.  Isolation began to set in—but not the kind of fashionable isolation that one might evince by wearing a leather jacket.  I resolved to correct this discrepancy between myself as I imagined—a leather jacket-wearing, freethinking rebel who had not given up his teenage rage against the machine, and the person I was—an office worker who sleeps on a twin bed.  I wanted people to look at me and think, he probably smokes cigarettes, listens to classic rock in cool bars and drinks whiskey, although I do none of those. 

I hit eBay and Amazon.com to make sure I had a new jacket for the autumn.  I couldn’t bear to face the season with only a hoodie.  The common wisdom was that you couldn’t find a good jacket for under $500, but that didn’t take into account the cost-savings of sweat shop labor.  So I purchased this Pakistani-made <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IVP0U4C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IVP0U4C&linkCode=as2&tag=lovetruthlife-20&linkId=4ec242bee3a24e869a5f74ea147740a1">MILWAUKEE LEATHER Men's Classic Side Lace Police Style Motorcycle Jacket</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=lovetruthlife-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00IVP0U4C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and I could not be happier with the results.

When it arrived, I took in the strange smell of shrink-wrapped leather, and wondered what the cow must have felt like when it died.  I tried the jacket on and found it to be somewhat too big, but in a good way.  My shoulders appeared enormous.  Now, people mistake me for a tough guy.  Women cross the street to avoid me at night.  I am acutely aware of the fact that I look like a mugger from an ’80s movie, or the popular Sega Genesis video game,  [“The Streets of Rage.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Rage_(video_game))  I feel empowered by the discomfort I cause to others.  

>I am no longer invisible.

I still don't particularly like whiskey, but I look like I do.  The other night in downtown Philadelphia, I saw a shifty man take one look at me, turn away, and elect instead to tail a more vulnerable person down the street.  Another man straight up gave me his wallet, instead of asking for mine.  I'm extremely pleased with this purchase--I now look like the cool guy I always wanted to be.  Props to the laborers who cranked this out.
