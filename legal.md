We hate to admit it forthrightly, but this website is a mash of news, satire, advertisements, and clickbait.  The content is intended to be entertaining, not informative.  It’s a big mistake to read our product endorsements or any other claims on their face.  Our spiritual and relationship advice, however, is on the money.  (Money, by the way, is the reason we’re doing this thing.)

All claims made here have not been evaluated by anyone, not the FDA, not our parents, and not even ourselves.  

Unless indicated otherwise, images on this site are not our property.

We haven't quite learned what legalese to include in a privacy policy, so check back for that!  However, at this time, we are collecting no personal information from our users.  We don't even know how to.  Whatever Google, Amazon and Facebook are doing is their own thing.
